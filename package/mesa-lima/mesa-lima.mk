# NOTE: this is a hack. It is not how packages generally look like in
# Buildroot.
# The proper way to do this would be to add lima support to the mesa3d package
# in upstream Buildroot. However, lima currently requires the use of
# non-upstream kernel and non-upstream mesa repos, which makes such a change
# unsuitable to be merged in upstream Buildroot yet.
# Since mesa3d is a slightly complicated package, in order to support lima on
# it now, we either do the below hacks and append some variables to the
# existing mesa3d recipe, or create a fork of the entire Buildroot tree.
# Maintaining a fork would be more work now and would quickly become out of
# sync with upstream Buildroot, so just do the below hacks.

# Always enable mesa debug for mesa-lima development
MESA3D_CONF_OPTS += --enable-debug

# Avoid "configure: error: Python mako module v0.8.0 or higher not found"
# Sorry about this. Appending dependencies would not work in this package
# 'extension'.

# Using local.mk, after the rsync we end up with no git repo.
# Setting MESA_GIT_SHA1_OVERRIDE will put this string to the GL_VERSION.
# Also, the build will detect it's the same all the time and avoid
# rebuilding some mesa libs on every build by not writing the git_sha1.h
# file unnecessarily.
